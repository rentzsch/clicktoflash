		<div class="content_box" id="updating-issue">
			<h2 id="updating_troubles">Updating Troubles:</h2>
			<p>ClickToFlash has some troubles updating because of how it loads into
			other applications.  If you are having problems updating ClickToFlash
			via the automatic updater, please download and install the latest
			ClickToFlash update manually from the website via the download
			links at the top of <a href="index.html">this page</a>.</p>
			
			<p>In particular, if you were automatically updated to ClickToFlash 1.5 or 1.5.1,
			you'll need to manually download and upgrade to 1.5.2 or later yourself.</p>
			
			<p>We are in the process of fixing all these problems for ClickToFlash 1.6,
			but for now you'll have to bear with us.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content_box" id="installer-issue">
			<h2 id="installation_troubles">Installation Troubles:</h2>
			<p>When installing ClickToFlash, you may receive this error if you've installed ClickToFlash before:</p>
			
			<pre><code>Installer could not install files in /tmp</code></pre>
			
			<p>This is a known problem with pre-release versions of 1.4 and 1.5.  To fix it, open the Terminal
			(located in the Applications folder), and type in the following command, followed by
			a return:</p>
			
			<pre><code>sudo pkgutil --forget com.github.rentzsch.clicktoflash.pkg</code></pre>
			
			<p>A password may be required.  If it asks for your password, type it in (you will not
			see any letters, numbers, or bullets), and then press return again.</p>
			
			<p>You may also see this error after issuing the aforementioned Terminal command: </p>
			
			<pre><code>No receipt for 'com.github.rentzsch.clicktoflash.pkg' found at '/'</code></pre>
			
			<p>Don't worry, that's OK.  ClickToFlash should now install normally.</p>
			
			<h3 id="further_problems">Further problems:</h3>
			<p>If the installer is <strong>still</strong> giving you troubles, and you're running under a non-admin user,
			type the following terminal command, followed by a return:</p>
			
			<pre><code>su admin_user -c 'touch /Library/Receipts/ClickToFlash.pkg'</code></pre>
			
			<p>replacing "admin_user" with the short user name of an admin user.  You will need to enter a password as well,
			and then type return again.  Now attempt ClickToFlash installation again.</p>

		<div class="content_box" id="pandorajam-issue">
			<h2 id="pandorajam_troubles">PandoraJam Troubles:</h2>
			<p>If you're having troubles with PandoraJam, make sure you are running ClickToFlash 1.5 or later, and
			<a href="http://www.bitcartel.com/pandorajam/">upgrade to
				PandoraJam</a> 1.4 (build 288) or later.
		</div>
		
		<div class="content_box" id="application-whitelist">
			<h2 id="application_whitelist">Application Whitelist:</h2>
			<p>ClickToFlash 1.5 and higher now include an application whitelist.  For apps that absolutely require
			Flash, ClickToFlash may cause the app to not function at all, or it may cause severe inconveniences.  If an
			app is on the application whitelist, ClickToFlash will automatically load all Flash.</p>
			
			<p>Currently, the application whitelist does not have a GUI.  Use the following Terminal command (or your favorite
			plist editor) to add apps to the whitelist, replacing "bundleID" with the bundle ID of the app you're whitelisting:</p>
			
			<pre><code class="small_code">defaults write com.github.rentzsch.clicktoflash applicationWhitelist -array-add bundleID</code></pre>
			
			<p><b>App developers:</b> you do not need to wait for a new release of ClickToFlash in order to use the
			application whitelist.  Simply include a key named "ClickToFlashOptOut" in your app's Info.plist file, set
			its value to "YES", and your app will automatically be whitelisted by ClickToFlash.</p>
